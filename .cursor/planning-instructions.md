# Planning Instructions

## Planning Process

### 1. Plan First, Code Second
- Always write a detailed plan before implementing any code
- Let AI critique and refine the plan before proceeding with implementation
- Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps

### 2. Step-by-Step Reasoning
- Ask for step-by-step reasoning before writing any code
- Explain the logic and approach for each implementation step
- Validate the reasoning with AI before proceeding

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Plan**: Outline what needs to be done
2. **Critique**: Have AI review and improve the plan
3. **Reason**: Explain step-by-step how to implement before writing any code
4. **Approval** Wait for approval before writing any code
5. **Testing** Treat the tests as integration tests. Never mock to make them just pass
5. **Code**: Only then proceed with actual implementation. Make the test pass

This approach ensures better code quality, fewer bugs, and more maintainable solutions.
